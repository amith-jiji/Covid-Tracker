## COVID-19 Tracker

Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. As developers we can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. This is a COVID-19 Tracker/Stats React application which fetches the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax. Using the data fetched from the API the statistics is displayed by using cards as well as Charts.
